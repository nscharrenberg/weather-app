## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://github.com/nscharrenberg/weather-app/blob/dev/demo/frontend.png?raw=true)

An easy to use weather application utilizing buienradar.nl to show the dutch local weather information.

## Built With
* [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-6.0)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v6)
* [Recharts](https://recharts.org/)
* [Buienradar](https://www.buienradar.nl/)

## Adjustments

A brief mention on some aspects that either should be present or have been altered for the sake of time or resources.

1.  Icons have been altered, as some of them are part of the "PRO' package of Font Awesome, and thus not available.
2. Material UI has been used as a UI framework to speed up the development process, and keep the design to industry standard.
3. Filtering is done based on the Region and Weather Station. So "Arcen" and "Venlo"  will both show "Meetstation Arcen (Venlo)"
4. Testing has not been performed due to time limitations. However, some tests that could have been performed were unit tests on testing specific components such as the Autocomplete, or displaying of weather data.

Due to the size of the application, this has been simply tested manually by performing actions.
